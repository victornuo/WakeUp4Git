@W: MT532 :"c:\users\victor ros\documents\cookies\wake_up_radio\auxpoyect\ringoscillatorcookie\hdl\ledbartimer.vhd":49:4:49:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 27 sequential elements including ledbarTimer_0/Ledaux[9:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can adversely impact design performance.
