@W: MT532 :"c:\users\victor\documents\cookies\wake_up_radio\auxpoyect\ringoscillator\smartgen\clkcouter\clkcouter_mod.vhd":104:4:104:16|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 0 sequential elements including clkCouter_0/DFN1E1C0_NU_3.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can adversely impact design performance.
